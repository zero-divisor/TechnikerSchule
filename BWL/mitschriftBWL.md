## Unternehmensgr端ndung

#### [Unternehmensgr端ndung Blended Learning Aufgabe](https://github.com/zero-divisor/TechnikerSchule/blob/master/BWL/ExistenzgruendungAusgefuellt.pdf)

## Rechtsformen

I've started work on the third iteration of bashtop->bpytop.
It's being written in C++ and will simply be called `btop`.

I'm aiming at releasing a beta version around August this year and will publish the repo when I've got the core functionality and structure ready for anybody that wanna help out.

This project is gonna take some time until it has complete feature parity with bpytop, since all system information gathering will likely have to be written from scratch without any external libraries.
And will need some help in the form of code contributions to get complete support for BSD and OSX.

If you got suggestions of C++ libraries that are multi-platform and are as extensive as [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) are for python, feel free to open up a new thread in Discussions, it could help speed up the development a lot.

Will post any updates about this project here until the repo is made available.
